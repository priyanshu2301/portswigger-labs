==> SQLi lab 7
==> Goal: determining the number of columns returned by the query

means that on the backend the query that is used in the product category filter how many columns is that query using?

> it's a simple one step solution
payload: ' order by 4--
output: internal server error that means query is using 3 columns

> but the above payload won't solve the lab because they want us to perform it with UNION operation
so our payload will be diffrent
we can try out by sending values with 1 column.. 2 columns etc
payload: ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--
output: we have used select operator with 3 columns giving them a null value and if that returns with 200 OK message that proves that query is 
using 3 columns.
